# Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning in R

   The Supervised ML project was knit to pdf and has 77 pages. The Unsupervised ML project was published to Rpubs
   because of its size. This is the link to the project http://rpubs.com/Wendy_Oira/882362
   
## *Unsupervised Machine Learning Dataset*

## *Define the question*

-   Learn the characteristics of customer groups of Kira Plastinina
-   Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and 
    visualizations.
-   Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned 
    this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting 
    the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your
    analysis.

## *Metric of success*

-   Successfully perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis 
    and visualizations.

## *The context*

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of
retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, 
and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand
their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year.
More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer 
groups.

## *Experimental design taken*

1.  Define the question, the metric for success, the context,
    experimental design taken.

2.  Read and explore the given dataset.

3.  Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given
    question.

4.  Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the
    dataset.

5.  Perform univariate, bivariate recording your observations.

6.  Perform Clustering.

7.  Recommendation and conclusions


# *Supervised Machine Learning Dataset*

## *Define the question*

-   Identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads.
-   Create a model that will predict whether an individual is most likely to 
    click on the ad.

## *Metric of success*

-   Because we are creating a classification model, our metric of success will 
    be accuracy score. We will set the minimum accuracy score to 90%.

## *The context*

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and
would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences
originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to
advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the
process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science
Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to
click on her ads.

## *Experimental design taken*

1.  Define the question, the metric for success, the context,
    experimental design taken.

2.  Read and explore the given dataset.

3.  Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given
    question.

4.  Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the
    dataset.

5.  Perform univariate, bivariate recording your observations.

6.  Perform unsupervised learning with several models

7.  Recommendations and conclusions
